### A Unique Learning Experience

I'm proud and grateful to have heard about an exclusive opportunity I happened to find through my meetup connections: [<a href="http://odsc.com/" target="_blank">Open Data Sci Conference West Coast 2015</a>][4]! A memorable chapter and Genesis in a journey to discover more Data Science, Engineering &amp; Analytics, all of which I'm happy to share with fellow friends and followers. As a novelty-seeking college senior, it truly marked a unique point in my studies where I segue from public education environment into a new world of fluid, startup-type learning kind of deal.

Not alone bound by the previous incentives of grades or a diploma, I felt enspirited by attending this conference, simply because I had the valuable chance to absorb the ideas of the best minds in the field (hopefully earning mentor thoughts en route) like a sponge, and the power to choose from a variety of diverse [workshops][8] and [speakers][7]. And the cool, relaxing scenery by the San Francisco Bay at Waterfront Hotel venue is a bonus! These are the special ingredients needed to pursue the next steps in establishing my own respectable professional career which mix well into a sure recipe for success. But I'm forgetting another ingredient...

###Keynote Opening Presentations

How trite for yet another Data Scientist with a Physics background to do honor and lead the introduction. The 1st keynote quickly kicked off with none other than Dr. Brian Granger, physicist and co-author of IPython Notebook, and the takehome point I enjoyed from his presentation is along the lines of

* Programs are optimized to process data
* People are optimized to process stories

which is quite fitting given the idea of the Notebook tool which interactively combines code with media. Not surprisingly I'm racking my brains to recall the bottom line delivered by the presenter of the 2nd keynote which evades me at the moment (likely due to the serial position effect AKA primacy-recency effect<sup id="serial-position-effect">[\[1\]][11]</sup>), although I remember the speaker passionately about Crowdflower. How could I forgot his main idea he enthusiastically discussed? Is it in my notes somewhere I can find? As expected however, I do remember the third keynote second-best!<sup id="primacy-recency-effect">[\[2\]][12]</sup>

Vin Sharma's presentation described Data Science as a [protoscience][14], analogizing it to similar developments in alchemy and talked about philosophical aspects of typical processes and workflows. Resonates deeply with my approach in science that encourages fresh and new perspectives to new ideas which may not necessarily be as rigorous or established as other branches of knowledge, yet nonetheless have untapped potential that incentivizes us to explore beyond convention. Again, resonates with my personal philosophy that it's fine to recognize your unique beliefs and accept religion as your identity while practicing the sciences too.

In the same manner that alchemy helped spur the development of chemistry, or that geometry had once been considered a sacred mystical endeavor, or that elements of psychoanalysis influence psychiatric therapy, Data Science will never be forgetten as a field which potentially establishes itself as a respected discipline or evolves into an even greater idea. The effects of history in protoscience have resounding present-day ramifications, which is why it's so important we study it and be part of it together. This excellent blogpost and partner content from Khanacademy by Michelle Feder<sup id="alchemy-history">[\[3\]][15]</sup> is a tour throughout alchemical history and an example of how rich diverse cultures contribute to the shaping the modern chemistry

> ### Importance of Protosciences
> Just as alchemy was a touch point for myriad crafts, creations, and — for its time — cures, chemistry resides in the center of the sciences. As an inquisitive discipline, chemistry touches physics on one side and biology on the other. Chemical questions lead to environmental, industrial, and medical applications.

The 3rd keynote provided closure for the introductions which also adequately left the audience with the feeling mystery, an air of inpsiration and wonder at the new era of science brought on by the a deluge of data. My fellow mentor enjoyed Vin's lecture as well, and I should ask him why it stands out in his perspective (I also reached out to Vin by email and twitter, so hopefully he can touch base with me soon for an engaging further discussion). 5 stars

### Workshops and Speakers

I had a chance to attend Neo4J's workshop where I happily recall we crash-course learned to "draw art with ascii" in reference to their hip query language syntax, thanks to Data Scientist Nicole White. Also checked out Galvanize's D3.js short tutorial whose resources are on github. Nina Zumel and John Mount's    John Myles White Cole Knaflic's better late than never Dato 

I've still to ask my fellow Triton classmates (mainly graduate students/researchers) their experience on the remaining workshops and speakers they attended on my behalf due to conflict at being in concurrent presentations near adjacent rooms. But I did follow up later after the conference ended and conveniently asked the organizer team on twitter if they could share their video resources. Luckily, they were super nice and accesible with their quick response

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/M8taD8ta">@M8taD8ta</a> There&#39;s a Playlist just for workshops: <a href="https://t.co/ig8PtYFPT5">https://t.co/ig8PtYFPT5</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ODSC?src=hash">#ODSC</a></p>&mdash; Open Data Science (@odsc) <a href="https://twitter.com/odsc/status/671712884922126337">December 1, 2015</a></blockquote>

And I obviously reciprocated their kindness by sharing with my many friends at school and new friends I found at a following Galvanize meetup a few weeks later.

### Welcome to Our Table!

Dato I heard of their service before from my fellow UCSD alumni who I shared a data project on Macy's wedding SEO data with. I remember their table being extremely friendly and I said to the VP of Marketing "I'd like to share a gift with you!" I also asked about her personal story and how she arrived at the conferenced

generous 
a new grad she asked me I gave her good advice demonstrates the power of friendship reference

didn't even know my old company at Qualcomm had an Analytics team (must be ears only!)

less formal networking questions

Who are your faculty advisor(s) or the leadership team?
What is your role in the organization?
When did you get started in Data Science?
Where are the rest of your team members I can meet with?
How did you hear about the event?

the key ingredient is humility and recognitition of the people who have gone before us, regardless of their background, and suffered and fought for justice that give us our individual priveleges and freedoms we enjoy today.

we've come quite far, but we still have much further to go!
