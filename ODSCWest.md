### A Unique Learning Experience

I'm proud and grateful to have heard about an exclusive opportunity I found through my meetup connections: [<a href="http://odsc.com/" target="_blank">Open Data Sci Conference West Coast 2015</a>][4]! A memorable chapter and Genesis in a journey to discover more Data Science, Engineering &amp; Analytics, all of which I'm happy to share with fellow friends and followers. As a novelty-seeking college senior, it truly marked a unique point in my studies where I segue from public education environment into a new world of fluid, startup-type learning kind of deal.

Not alone bound by the previous incentives of grades or a diploma, I felt enspirited by attending this conference, simply because I had the valuable chance to absorb the ideas of the best minds in the field (hopefully earning mentor thoughts en route) like a sponge, and the power to choose from a variety of diverse [workshops][8] and [speakers][7]. And the cool, relaxing scenery by the San Francisco Bay at Waterfront Hotel venue is a bonus! These are the special ingredients needed to pursue the next steps in establishing my own respectable professional career which mix well into a sure recipe for success. But I'm forgetting one particular ingredient...

###Keynote Opening Presentations

How trite for yet another Data Scientist with a Physics background to do honor and lead the introduction. The 1st keynote quickly kicked off with none other than Dr. Brian Granger, physicist and co-author of IPython Notebook, and the takehome point I enjoyed from his presentation is along the lines of

* Programs are optimized to process data
* People are optimized to process stories

which is quite fitting given the idea of the Notebook tool which interactively combines code with media. Not surprisingly I'm racking my brains to recall the bottom line delivered by the presenter of the 2nd keynote which evades me at the moment (likely due to the serial position effect AKA primacy-recency effect<sup id="serial-position-effect">[\[1\]][11]</sup>), although I remember the speaker passionately about Crowdflower. How could I forgot his main idea he enthusiastically discussed? Is it in my notes somewhere I can find? As expected however, I do remember the third keynote second-best!<sup id="primacy-recency-effect">[\[2\]][12]</sup>

<iframe class="center" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/dQ5Gl93NKeUOZH" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
<div class="center" style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/VinSharma1/open-data-science-conference-philosophers-stone" title="Data Science: Philosopher&#x27;s Stone" target="_blank">Data Science: Philosopher&#x27;s Stone</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/VinSharma1" target="_blank">Vin Sharma</a></strong> </div>

Vin Sharma's presentation described Data Science as a [protoscience][14], analogizing it to similar developments in alchemy and talked about philosophical aspects of typical processes and workflows. Resonates deeply with my approach in science that encourages fresh and new perspectives to new ideas which may not necessarily be as rigorous or established as other branches of knowledge, yet nonetheless have untapped potential that incentivizes us to explore beyond convention. Again, it resonates with my personal philosophy that it's fine to recognize your unique beliefs and accept religion as your identity while practicing the sciences too.

In the same manner that alchemy helped spur the development of chemistry, or that geometry had once been considered a sacred mystical endeavor, or that elements of psychoanalysis influence psychiatric therapy, Data Science will never be forgetten as a field which potentially establishes itself as a respected discipline or evolves into an even greater idea. The effects of history in protoscience have resounding present day ramifications, which is why it's so important we study it and be part of it together. This excellent blogpost and partner content from Khan Academy by Michelle Feder<sup id="alchemy-history">[\[3\]][15]</sup> is a tour throughout alchemical history and an example of how rich diverse cultures contribute to the shaping of modern chemistry

> #### Importance of Protosciences
> Just as alchemy was a touch point for myriad crafts, creations, and — for its time — cures, chemistry resides in the center of the sciences. As an inquisitive discipline, chemistry touches physics on one side and biology on the other. Chemical questions lead to environmental, industrial, and medical applications.

The 3rd keynote provided closure for the introductions which also adequately left the audience with the feeling mystery, an air of inpsiration and wonder at the new era of science brought on by the a deluge of data. My fellow mentor enjoyed Vin's lecture as well, and I should ask him why it stands out in his perspective (I also reached out to Vin by email and twitter. Hopefully he'll touch base with me soon for an engaging further discussion.) 5 stars

*Oh and by the way he did get back, hence his slideshare I embedded. How friendly!*

### Workshops and Speakers

I had a chance to sit in on Neo4J's workshop where I happily recall we crash-course learned to "draw art with ascii" in reference to their hip query language syntax, thanks to Data Scientist Nicole White. Also checked out Galvanize's D3.js short tutorial whose resources are on github. Lastly I had the pleasure to finally enjoy Dr. John Myles White's Julia lecture in the language's ongoing developments &mdash; since I missed him when he last visited UCSD &mdash; and I found [Cole Knaflic's storytelling][19] presentation to be a terrific and riveting tale as [she teaches us][20] how to combine colors and communication, verbal and visuals for impactfulness. More tips covered include thinking about proximity, contrast, closure and similarity in data graphics.

I'm touched and impressed how, within the very first 10 minutes of her talk, she already captured the salient points of focusing on appealing to audiences' feelings (the "context") first and then convince them with relevant facts for support, and referencing the [importance of position, size, and color][24]. I had to listen closely to follow along intently &mdash; due to her popularity, the room was packed so paying attention and listening to her experience as well as observing her presentation style was an invaluable challenge.

I've still to ask my fellow Triton classmates, mainly graduate students, their experience on the remaining workshops and speakers they attended on my behalf due to conflict at being in concurrent presentations near adjacent rooms. But I did follow up later after the conference ended and conveniently asked the organizer team on twitter if they could share their video resources. Luckily, they were super nice and accesible with their quick response:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/M8taD8ta">@M8taD8ta</a> There&#39;s a Playlist just for workshops: <a href="https://t.co/ig8PtYFPT5">https://t.co/ig8PtYFPT5</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ODSC?src=hash">#ODSC</a></p>&mdash; Open Data Science (@odsc) <a href="https://twitter.com/odsc/status/671712884922126337">December 1, 2015</a></blockquote>

And I obviously reciprocated their kindness by sharing the playlist link with my wide network of friends at school, as well as new friends I met at Galvanize's mixer meetup a few weeks later. Share if you care indeed.

### Welcome to Our Table!

I first heard of the book <i>Practical Data Science with R</i> from my dear Math professor in college at UCSD who taught one of the first new [Data Analysis][21] classes. As homework, we read Win Vector's guest [blogpost][22] article on log transforming data (a sneak peek of PDSwR's Chapter 4.) Suprised to hear they were making an appearance at the conference, I made it a plan to attend in Nina Zumel and John Mount's workshop, as well as drop by to say hi to them afterward at their table for book signing. "We really like you at UCSD!" I said as I smiled to them, "Our Math professor had us read your blog for a homework assignment. I also enjoyed the workshop! It was very *practical*." A sly reference to the title of their eponymous book.

As a testament to how attractive and popular the conference was, I even met Dato that weekend. I first heard of their service from my fellow UCSD alumni, Sang, who I worked with a data project on to [analyze Macy's wedding SEO data][23]. I remember their table being extremely excited to know we used their product, and I said surreptitiously to the VP of Marketing, "I'd like to share this gift with you!" I also engaged with Rebecca in a casual chat and asked about her personal story, how she found about the conference and got involved.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/datoinc">@datoinc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jjangsangy">@jjangsangy</a> is a fan of Dato! Sang is our partner who first introduced Dato to us :)</p>&mdash; Kevin Hung (@M8taD8ta) <a href="https://twitter.com/M8taD8ta/status/668187295179083776">November 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

At the same Galvanize holiday meetup SF Data Mining hosted following the ODSC event, I listened to a lecture given by her husband on analyzing log data. I made sure to show him our unique Christmas present, and he proposed an idea that we could maybe share on the Dato blog. I followed up shortly after the event, and I feel personally excited to hear more about their good work in the future.

### Mixer, Courtesy of DataRobot

A generous evening with snacks and cocktails provided by DataRobot, a Boston AI company, was a great opportunity to meet with folks in a relaxed atmosphere, appropriate for the Thanksgiving holiday season. Wearing my signature Qualcomm jacket, I attracted the attention a fellow named David who quickly pointed out he worked on Qualcomm's Analytics team. We exchanged backgrounds and he asked if I had any classmates who were interested in coaching him through his studies in Predictive Analytics, given I told him I help lead UCSD's Data Science club.

I also happily met a fellow new grad and we were happy to appreciate each other's situation. She moved from the East Coast after graduation and probed if I had luck landing a job. Not yet, but I gave her great tips to demonstrate the power of friendship. "Do you have friends working at local companies? 90% of hiring is based on referrals!" I made the mistake of forgetting to ask for her contact, so let that be a painful reminder for me to invest in business cards. Hope we meet again soon, *friend*! Yes, friendship is certainly a power, and the ability of asking is an asset as well:

Questions I should propose in future meetups to network effectively

- Who is part of the leadership team/your faculty lab advisor? (ask more people of influence)
- What is your role or what kind of work you do in your company? (organizational structure)
- When did you get your start in the field? When will I see you soon? (history, recency, followup)
- Where is your team or who do you suggest that I meet/speak with? Where are the sponsors? (context: surveying terrain, environment-mapping)
- Why did you feel like dropping by? (motivations, objectives)
- How did you hear about the event? (sourcing strategy)
- Can I get you coffee or tea sometime? Are you down for drinks? (reciprocity, relationship-building)
- Do you have closing comments or feedback? (closure, perception)

will constantly be expanded when I learn which ones fit the context. Open gestures and friendly body language are also good signals to keep in mind.. doesn't it account for 80% of communication?

not enough young inexperienced cut off everyone's voice is important to hear


timothy silicon railroad tim hwang

the key ingredient is humility and recognitition of the people who have gone before us, regardless of their background, and suffered and fought for justice that give us our individual priveleges and freedoms we enjoy today.

we've come quite far, but we still have much further to go!
